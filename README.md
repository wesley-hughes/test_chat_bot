# AI Chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3

This project is a simple AI chatbot that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 to generate responses to user inputs. The application is built using Python and the Gradio library for the interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or above
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd your_project
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create an `.env` file in the project directory and add your OpenAI API key.

```env
openai_apikey=your_api_key
```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch a Gradio interface in your default web browser. You can interact with the AI chatbot by typing a message in the textbox and clicking the "Click" button. The AI will then generate a response based on the conversation history.
